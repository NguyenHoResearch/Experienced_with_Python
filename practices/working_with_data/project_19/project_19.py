# %% 1. What is an API?
# An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
# APIs enable developers to fetch data, send data, and interact with external services.
# Examples include retrieving weather data, financial market information, and more.
# 
# Example: Fetching weather data.
# You send a request for weather data, and then there is a responseâ€”the data returned by the API.
# When you make a request, you receive a response from the API.
# 
# The API endpoint is a specific URL that provides access to an API function.
# Additionally, an API key is a unique identifier required to access the API securely.
# 
# Typically, an API request consists of:
# - An **endpoint** (a URL that grants access to an API function).
# - An **API key** (which identifies the user and authorizes access).
# - The **request** (the action performed to retrieve or send data).
# 
# When you send a request to the API endpoint, you include an API key to let the server know who you are and why you are calling that endpoint.
# Based on the request, the API returns a response with the requested data.

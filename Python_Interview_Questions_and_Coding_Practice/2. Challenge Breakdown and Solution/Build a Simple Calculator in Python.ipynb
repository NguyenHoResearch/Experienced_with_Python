Below is a detailed explanation of how the solution works:\n","\n","#### 1. Modular Design\n","\n","The solution is divided into modular functions, each responsible for a specific arithmetic operation:\n","\n","- `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.\n","- `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.\n","- `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.\n","- `divide(x, y)`: Handles division and checks for division by zero.\n","\n","This modular design ensures that each function is focused on a single task, making the code easier to read, test, and maintain.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 2. Handling Edge Cases\n","\n","##### Division by Zero\n","\n","- The `divide` function explicitly checks if the divisor (`y`) is zero.\n","- If `y == 0`, it returns `\"Error: Division by zero\"` instead of performing the division, preventing runtime errors.\n","\n","##### Invalid Operations\n","\n","- The `calculator` function validates the `operation` argument.\n","- If the operation is not one of the supported strings (`\"add\"`, `\"subtract\"`, `\"multiply\"`, `\"divide\"`), it returns `\"Error: Invalid operation\"`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 3. Implementation of the `calculator` Function\n","\n","The `calculator` function acts as the main entry point for the program. It performs the following steps:\n","\n","##### 1. Input Validation:\n","\n","- Checks if the `operation` argument is valid.\n","- Maps the `operation` string to the corresponding function (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).\n","\n","##### 2. Operation Execution:\n","\n","- Calls the appropriate function based on the `operation` argument.\n","- Passes the operands (`x` and `y`) to the selected function.\n","\n","##### 3. Return the Result:\n","\n","- Returns the result of the operation or an error message if an edge case occurs.\n","\n","##### 4. Floating-Point Precision\n","\n","Pythonâ€™s built-in arithmetic operators handle both integers and floating-point numbers seamlessly.  \n","However, when testing floating-point results:\n","\n","- Use assertions like `assertAlmostEqual` to compare results within a small tolerance (e.g., 7 decimal places).\n","- This accounts for minor rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 5. Output Format\n","\n","The `calculator` function returns results in the following formats:\n","\n","- A numeric value (integer or float) for valid operations.\n","- A string `\"Error: Division by zero\"` if division by zero occurs.\n","- A string `\"Error: Invalid operation\"` if the operation is unsupported.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 6. Example Walkthrough\n","\n","##### Example 1: Addition\n","**Input:**  \n","`operation = \"add\"`, `x = 10`, `y = 5`\n","\n","- Calls the `add` function: `add(10, 5)`\n","- Returns: `15`\n","\n","**Output:**  \n","`15`\n","\n","---\n","\n","##### Example 2: Division by Zero\n","**Input:**  \n","`operation = \"divide\"`, `x = 10`, `y = 0`\n","\n","- Calls the `divide` function: `divide(10, 0)`\n","- Detects division by zero and returns `\"Error: Division by zero\"`\n","\n","**Output:**  \n","`\"Error: Division by zero\"`\n","\n","---\n","\n","##### Example 3: Invalid Operation\n","**Input:**  \n","`operation = \"modulus\"`, `x = 10`, `y = 5`\n","\n","- Detects invalid operation and returns `\"Error: Invalid operation\"`\n","\n","**Output:**  \n","`\"Error: Invalid operation\"`\n","\n","---\n","\n","##### Example 4: Floating-Point Numbers\n","**Input:**  \n","`operation = \"multiply\"`, `x = 10.5`, `y = 5.25`\n","\n","- Calls the `multiply` function: `multiply(10.5, 5.25)`\n","- Returns: `55.125`\n","\n","**Output:**  \n","`55.125`\n","\n","#### 7. Time and Space Complexity\n","\n","- **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n","  - Each operation has a constant runtime regardless of input size.\n","- **Space Complexity**: O(1)\n","  - Uses a fixed amount of space for calculations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 8. Key Takeaways\n","\n","- Modular design makes the code reusable and extendable.\n","- Edge cases (e.g., division by zero, invalid ops) are handled cleanly.\n","- Floating-point precision is carefully managed in tests.\n","- Test cases validate correctness across all scenarios.\n","\n","> This approach ensures that the calculator is robust, efficient, and user-friendly."],"metadata":{"id":"4A9UYN6e51tJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def add(x, y):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Returns the sum of x and y.\n","  \"\"\"\n","  return x + y\n","\n","def subtract(x, y):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Returns the subtract of x and y.\n","  \"\"\"\n","  return x - y\n","\n","def multiply(x, y):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Returns the sum of x and y.\n","  \"\"\"\n","  return x * y\n","\n","def divide(x, y):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Returns the divide of x and y.\n","  \"\"\"\n","  return x / y\n","\n","def calculator(operation, x, y):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Performs the specified operation on x and y.\n","  Supported operations: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'.\n","  \"\"\"\n","\n","  if operation == \"add\":\n","    return add(x, y)\n","  elif operation == \"subtract\":\n","    return subtract(x, y)\n","  elif operation == \"multiply\":\n","    return multiply(x, y)\n","  elif operation == \"divide\":\n","    return divide(x, y)\n","  else:\n","    return \"Error: Invalid operation\"\n","\n","calculator(\"add\", 10, 5)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9IC3E6n719ed","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744426090793,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Nguyen Ho","userId":"13677500467458071571"}},"outputId":"e5c3f6f7-2c6e-4263-bacb-0533008880dd"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["15"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]}]}
